         <h2 id="modal-title">Ceremonial Vessel</h2>
         <p>3,800 Years BP  Western Nile Necropolis  Sand-Tempered Clay.</p>
         <p>Material: Volcanic basalt, lunar silicate, fused ash.</p>
         <p>Function (Hypothesized): Ritual container for oils or grains.</p>
         <p>Location Found: Burial chamber beneath sandstone table, Nile west bank.</p>
         <p>This black and gold jug fragment is believed to have served a ceremonial function, likely used in funerary or ritual contexts. Unearthed near a necropolis associated with elite burials, its preserved form and symbolic striping suggest it was not intended for daily use but for sacred rites.</p>
         <p>The vessel's slender neck and rounded midsection reflect hand crafted design, with interior oil marks confirming artisanal manufacture. Microscopic residue of olive oil and myrrh, along with exterior abrasions, indicate repeated ritual handling. Faded horizontal striping, once vivid, likely eroded due to burial abrasion over centuries.</p>
         <p>Associated finds include faience beads and linen fragments, reinforcing its ceremonial role. The vessel's color contrast, black and sand, symbolizes life and death, sun and shadow, echoing dualistic themes in Egyptian cosmology. Though similar in form to Middle Kingdom vessels from Thebes, its stylistic details align more closely with Lower Egyptian workshops. The stripe motif parallels friezes found on Mesa temple walls, suggesting a shared symbolic grammar across regions.</p>

         <h2 id="modal-title">Kohl Pot</h2>
         <p>3,200 Years BP Saqqara Necropolis</p>
         <p>Material: Alabaster, hand carved with metal tools.</p>
         <p>Function (Hypothesized): Cosmetic container for kohl application.</p>
         <p>Location Found: Discovered near Saqqara necropolis, a private tomb.</p>
         <p>Associated items, a shell palette, bronze applicator, and reed brush, reinforce its cosmetic function. The pot's craftsmanship and burial context denote high status and symbolic value; kohl was believed to offer magical protection.</p>
         <p>Like Theban examples, this vessel's higher lead content suggests regional variation in recipes and techniques. Its presence in a private tomb reflects the intersection of beauty, ritual, and identity in elite Egyptian burial practices.</p>

         <h2 id="modal-title">Bronze Kohl Applicator</h2>
         <p>22,000 Years BP  Dorsai Scarp Ridge  Composite Stone</p>
         <p>Material: Made from bronze, a copper alloy, cosmetic tool in New Kingdom Egypt</p>
         <p>Function (Hypothesized): Ceremonial or calendrical archway</p>
         <p>Location Found: Excavated from a tomb or domestic context given its cosmetic use.</p>
         <p>This precision-cut fragment is believed to be part of a ceremonial archway aligned with seasonal or celestial markers. Recovered from a wind stabilized ridge, its remote setting and foundation of deliberate stonework suggest it served as a passage or observation point, likely sacred in nature.</p>
         <p>The keystone features a 7-point symmetrical symbol array, possibly calendrical, and was carved with high accuracy using materials not native to the site. Surrounding finds (charcoal flecks, obsidian bead fragments, crushed pigment) point to ritual activity and intentional deposition. While it shares geometric similarities with the later standing stones at Aetha-Zul, this fragment displays a distinct symbolic grammar and a more advanced material blend, indicating a unique, localized cultural expression.</p>

         <p>Function (Hypothesized): Ceremonial or calendrical archway</p>
         <p>Location Found: Discovered in a shaft tomb near the Theban Necropolis, sealed inside a wooden box.</p>
         <p>This precision-cut fragment is believed to be part of a ceremonial archway aligned with seasonal or celestial markers. Recovered from a wind stabilized ridge, its remote setting and foundation of deliberate stonework suggest it served as a passage or observation point, likely sacred in nature.</p>

         <p>22,000 Years BP  Dorsai Scarp Ridge  Composite Stone</p>
         <p>Material: Forged iron, with surface pitting and oxidation. Handle composition is gold, glass, colored stone or faience inlays.</p>
         <p>Function (Hypothesized): Ceremonial or calendrical archway</p>
         <p>Location Found: Not specified. Likely an Egyptain royal or military grave due to stones and craftsmanship.</p>

         <p>Function (Hypothesized): Ceremonial or calendrical archway</p>
